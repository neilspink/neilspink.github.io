The rules are simple:
Write down your 100-day commitment. Pick a start date. Decide if it’s private, public, or shared with the community. Support the idea with a tip. That’s it. No feeds. No distractions. Just you versus the next 100 days.
The idea came from watching I Worked Out Like David Goggins for 100 Days.</description></item></channel></rss>
