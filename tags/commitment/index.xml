The rules are simple:
Write down your 100-day commitment. Pick a start date. Decide if it’s private, public, or shared with the community. Support the idea with a tip. That’s it. No feeds. No distractions. Just you versus the next 100 days.
The idea came from watching I Worked Out Like David Goggins for 100 Days.</description></item><item><title>Why Your Online Shop Isn’t Selling (And What I’d Do If I Were CEO)</title><link>https://neilspink.ch/posts/2026-01-18-onlineshop-search-results/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neilspink.ch/posts/2026-01-18-onlineshop-search-results/</guid><description>Recently, I went looking for a USB-C monitor. I typed exactly that into the onlineshop of the nearest electronics store getting nothing relevant back. Confused, I ran the same search on four more major Swiss retailers. One showed only cables. Two didn’t list any monitors. One buried the relevant products under five unrelated results. Only one got it right.
Maybe “Bildschirm” was the better term? Tried that. No improvement.
Your search engine is your sales team.</description></item></channel></rss>
